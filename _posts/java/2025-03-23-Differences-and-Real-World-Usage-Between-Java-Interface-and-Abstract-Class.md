# Differences and Real-World Usage Between Java Interface and Abstract Class

## 1. Java Interface

- **Fully Abstract**: Interfaces cannot have method implementations (before Java 8); only method declarations. Since Java 8, `default` and `static` methods are allowed with bodies.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: A class can implement multiple interfaces (solves the single inheritance limitation).
- **All variables** are implicitly `public static final` constants.
- **All methods** are implicitly `public abstract` (except `default` and `static`).
- **Used to define behaviors and capabilities**.

**Application Scenarios:**

- When you want to define a set of capabilities or behaviors without enforcing a specific implementation:
    - `Comparable` for comparison logic
    - `Runnable` for thread task execution
    - `Serializable` for object serialization
- When **multiple inheritance** is needed

## 2. Java Abstract Class

- **Can have both abstract and concrete methods (with bodies)**.
- **Can include member variables, constructors, and static blocks**.
- **Single inheritance only**: A class can only extend one abstract class.
- **Used for code reuse and structural design**.


**Application Scenarios:**

- When multiple classes share common implementation, but still need customization.
- When you want to provide a **default implementation or template method**.

| Feature             | Interface                                   | Abstract Class                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Method Implementation | Only abstract methods (Java 8+ allows `default`) | Both abstract and concrete methods           |
| Member Variables     | `public static final` constants only        | Can have any type of member variable         |
| Constructor          | No constructors                             | Can have constructors                        |
| Inheritance          | Supports multiple interfaces                | Single inheritance only                      |
| Purpose              | Defines behavior contracts                  | Promotes code reuse and structure            |
| Default Modifiers    | Methods: `public abstract`; Fields: `public static final` | Can use any access modifier              |

## 4. An Interview Question â€“ Zoo System Design

> Design a Zoo System where different animals (e.g., Tiger, Penguin, Parrot) have shared behaviors (like eating and sleeping) and unique capabilities (like flying or swimming). Some animals can fly, others can swim.

### Solution Design:
1. Use an **abstract class `Animal`** to hold common properties and behaviors (`name`, `eat()`, `sleep()`).
2. Use **interfaces** (`Flyable`, `Swimmable`) to represent optional capabilities.
3. Concrete animals extend `Animal` and implement the appropriate interfaces.

```java
// Interfaces
public interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

public interface Swimmable {
    void swim();
}

// Abstract Class
public abstract class Animal {
    protected String name;

    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating");
    }

    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println(name + " is sleeping");
    }

    public abstract void makeSound();
}

// Concrete Animal Classes
public class Tiger extends Animal implements Swimmable {
    public Tiger(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Roar!");
    }

    @Override
    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("Tiger swims powerfully.");
    }
}

public class Penguin extends Animal implements Swimmable {
    public Penguin(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Penguin squawks!");
    }

    @Override
    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("Penguin swims fast!");
    }
}

public class Parrot extends Animal implements Flyable {
    public Parrot(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Parrot says hello!");
    }

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Parrot is flying!");
    }
}
```

### Conclusion:

I used an abstract class `Animal` to provide common behavior like `eat()`` and `sleep()``, and kept `makeSound()`` as an abstract method because each animal makes a different sound.

For flying and swimming capabilities, I created interfaces (`Flyable`, `Swimmable`) so that these behaviors can be flexibly added to specific animal classes, without affecting inheritance structure.

This follows the object-oriented principle of **"composition over inheritance"** and improves code reusability and maintainability.
