# Evaluation and Redlines: Offline Baseline + Production Replay + Automatic Rollback
> **Goal:** A new model version should go live **only when data proves it's better**, otherwise, it automatically rolls back.

## 1. Why We Need "Redlines"
In many AI teams, new model versions are deployed based on gut feeling:\
\> "It looks better."\
\> "I tried a few prompts --- seems fine."

That approach might work at an early stage, but it becomes dangerous as systems scale. Three common issues quickly appear:
1. **No quantitative proof.** A new model may look smarter on a few samples but degrade overall accuracy.
2. **Hidden risks.** One small regression can trigger privacy leaks, citation loss, or higher latency for thousands of users.
3. **No accountability.** When something breaks, it's unclear which version caused it or why.

To fix this, we need a **data-driven release gate**, a structured way to measure, compare, and decide. The core idea is simple but powerful. We try to build an **offline baseline** to measure progress consistently; run **production replay** to see how new versions perform on real traffic; set **redline and yellowline thresholds** that trigger alerts or rollbacks automatically.

This is how we move from "it feels good" to "the data says it's good."

---

## 2. The Offline Baseline: Defining a Fair Comparison
Before testing a new model, we need a reference which is a consistent "control group" that captures what *good* performance looks like. That's what an **offline baseline** provides.

It's a fixed set of around **200 anonymized test samples**, and each includes,
- **Input:** a de-identified real or synthetic user request;
- **Checkpoints:** rules for evaluation (e.g., "must include citations," "must extract company and date");
- **Gold reference:** the expected output or key phrases.

These samples cover normal use cases, edge cases, and known problem areas from previous incidents. Running both the **stable** and **canary** models on this same dataset gives us a reliable side-by-side comparison. If a canary model can't perform well on this 200-sample baseline, it's unlikely to do better in production.

---

## 3. Production Replay: Testing on Real-World Traffic
Even if a model passes offline evaluation, it might still fail in production. Why? Because real-world data is messy, long, noisy, and unpredictable.

That's why we add a **production replay** step. We sample 24--72 hours of **real production traffic** (fully anonymized), and run both the stable and canary models on those same inputs. We then compare five key metrics,
1. **Accuracy**: How close the model output is to the expected answer
2. **Coverage**: Whether it covers required fields or key facts
3. **Citation Rate**: Whether it properly includes and aligns references
4. **Cost**: Dollar cost per 1K tokens or per request
5. **Latency**: Response time (P50/P95) is critical for user experience

This gives us a true picture of performance under realistic load and data diversity. **Production replay bridges the gap between "lab success" and "production reliability."**

## 4. The Redline and Yellowline System: When to Roll Back
Once we can measure, we need rules to decide what's acceptable, that is the **redline system**.

It should work like this,
- **Redline:** Critical failure. Automatically roll back.
- **Yellowline:** Minor regression. Pause rollout and alert for manual review.

For example, if Citation rate is lower 0.95, rollback operation will be performed. If Cost per 1K tokens exceeds, the system will send an alert. These thresholds are stored in a simple YAML configuration that becomes part of every release. Once triggered, the pipeline doesn't wait for human approval and it executes the decision automatically. 

This ensures **Objectivity**(decisions based on numbers, not opinions), **Speed**(rollback happening in minutes, not hours), and **Safety**(bad versions never reaching all users).

---

## 5. Automated Evaluation and CI/CD Integration
When a new model version is ready for release, the CI/CD pipeline runs an automated evaluation process.
1. Load the offline baseline samples.
2. Run both **stable** and **canary** models.
3. Compute the five metrics.
4. Compare them against the configured thresholds.
5. Output a decision: *Pass*, *Alert*, or *Rollback*.

If results are *Pass*, rollout continues. If any yellowline or redline is triggered, the system pauses or rolls back automatically.

---

## 6. A Real Example: The Canary That Got Rolled Back
During one release, our canary model seemed promising:
- Accuracy: 0.88 → 0.86
- Coverage: 0.97 → 0.93
- Citation rate: 0.98 → 0.92
- Cost: → -8%
- Latency: → -5%

Lower cost and faster speed looked great, but the citation rate dropped below 0.95, violating a redline. Within minutes, the system automatically rolled back the release and notified the on-call channel. No human had to intervene.

---

## 7. Conclusion
After adopting this system, people stop saying *"it feels better"* and start saying *"it performs 3% better on accuracy and 10% faster in latency."* Every release is measured on the same data. You can explain why a version passed or failed. Teams deploy faster, knowing rollback is automatic and safe. That is a mindset shift.

Additionally, in practice, there are more frequent and safer releases, fewer production issues, and lower risk for compliance and security teams.

> **The release gate is no longer built on trust. In fact, it is built on data.**

With offline baselines, production replay, and automated redlines, we no longer *hope* a model is better. In contract, we *prove* it is. Every deployment becomes safer, faster, and smarter.
