# A Complete Guide to Linear Regression (Theory + PyTorch Practice)

## Introduction: What is Linear Regression? 
Linear regression is one of the most fundamental **supervised learning algorithms in machine learning**.  
It is mainly used for solving **regression problems**, i.e. predicting **continuous values**, such as:  
- Housing prices
- Stock prices
- Sales forecasts

In this tutorial, we will cover **linear regression theory** step by step, followed by a **PyTorch implementation** with training code and examples.

### Core Idea of Linear Regression
We aim to fit a ‚Äúlinear model‚Äù that captures the relationship between input features and the output value. Mathematically:

`≈∑ = w·µÄx + b`

- `≈∑`: predicted output  
- `x`: input feature vector  
- `w`: weight vector (indicating feature importance)  
- `b`: bias term (controls overall offset)

## Key Concepts in Linear Regression
Here are some basic terms you‚Äôll encounter when studying **linear regression for beginners**:

| Concept        | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| Sample size `n` | Number of data rows (e.g., 100 houses with area and price info) |
| Feature dimension `d` | Number of input variables (e.g., area and age) |
| Training set   | Data used to train the model |
| Feature `x`     | Input values per sample (e.g., area, age) |
| Label `y`       | Ground truth output (e.g., price) |

---

## Mathematical Formulation

For 2D features: 
`price = w‚ÇÅ ¬∑ area + w‚ÇÇ ¬∑ age + b`  

For higher dimensions, the **linear regression equation** can be written as:   
`≈∑ = w‚ÇÅx‚ÇÅ + w‚ÇÇx‚ÇÇ + ‚ãØ + w·µ¢x·µ¢ + b = w·µÄx + b`


If we have `n` samples, we can use matrix notation:
- Feature matrix: `X ‚àà ‚Ñù‚ÅøÀ£·µà ` 
- Label vector: `y ‚àà ‚Ñù‚Åø`

Then:
`≈∑ = Xw + b`

---

## Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
We use the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as the loss function:

`L(w, b) = (1 / 2n) ¬∑ ‚àë(≈∑‚ÅΩ‚Å±‚Åæ ‚àí y‚ÅΩ‚Å±‚Åæ)¬≤`

- The smaller the value, the more accurate the model.
- Squaring amplifies the penalty for large errors.

## Training a Linear Regression Model

### Method 1: Analytical Solution (Closed-form)

If the dataset is small and the problem is linear, you can directly solve the optimal weights and bias using the formula:
`w* = (X·µÄX)‚Åª¬π X·µÄy`

This method is fast and accurate. However, it becomes impractical if:
- The dimensionality is too high
- The matrix is non-invertible
- Non-linear structure is introduced

### Method 2: Gradient Descent Optimization
We iteratively update the model parameters by minimizing the loss function.
Each step updates the weights and bias in the negative gradient direction:

`w ‚Üê w ‚àí Œ∑ ¬∑ ‚àáw L(w, b)`

`b ‚Üê b ‚àí Œ∑ ¬∑ ‚àáb L(w, b)`

- `Œ∑` is the learning rate (step size)
- `‚àáw` and `‚àáb` are gradients with respect to `w` and `b`

Common Practice: **Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**

Instead of using all data at once, we randomly select a small batch of samples to update the parameters each time:
- More efficient
- Faster convergence
- Widely used in deep learning

This is the standard approach used in **PyTorch linear regression tutorials**, because it scales well with large datasets and deep learning.

## Why Use Vectorization in Linear Regression?
Vectorization makes training faster by using optimized matrix operations instead of Python loops.

In training, we often perform large matrix operations. Vectorization improves efficiency by:
- Calling optimized low-level C libraries (e.g., BLAS)
- Speeding up computation by 100x or more
- Reducing the chance of bugs
- Avoiding slow for loops

---

## Why Squared Loss? Connection to Normal Distribution

We can model prediction error as `Gaussian noise`:

`y = w·µÄx + b + Œµ,   where Œµ ~ ùí©(0, œÉ¬≤)`

Using `Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)` to fit the model is mathematically equivalent to `minimizing the mean squared error (MSE)`:

`L(w, b) = (1 / 2n) ¬∑ ‚àë(≈∑‚ÅΩ‚Å±‚Åæ ‚àí y‚ÅΩ‚Å±‚Åæ)¬≤`

This is the mathematical motivation behind using `MSE`.

## From Linear Regression to Neural Networks
Linear regression can be seen as the **simplest neural network model** (a single-layer perceptron). This helps beginners connect regression to **deep learning basics**.

**Linear regression** can be seen as **the simplest form of a neural network**:
- Contains only **one fully-connected layer** (no activation function)
- Also known as a **single-layer perceptron** or **dense layer**

Just like a biological neuron:
- Input: `x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, ..., x·µ¢`
- Weights: `w`
- Bias: `b`
- Output: `o = w·µÄx + b`

---

## Analogy with Biological Neurons
A biological neuron structure includes:
- `Dendrites`: Receive inputs
- `Nucleus`: Perform weighted sum
- `Axon`: Pass the output to the next neuron

This is where the term **neural network** originates. Modern deep learning is more influenced by math and engineering than biology.
