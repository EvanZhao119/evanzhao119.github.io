# Versioned Prompts and Tool Contracts: Building a Safe, Auditable, and Rollback-Ready AI System

## 1. From “Prompt Words” to “System Logic”
Most people think a *prompt* is just a few words you type into ChatGPT and other AI platforms, something like *“Write a report about climate change.”* 

That’s true for casual use, but in an **AI production system**, a prompt is much more. 

It defines how your model behaves, what it outputs, and even how it interacts with external systems.

For example, a prompt like this,
```md
Output **JSON**: summary, kpiTable, exceptions[], citations[].
Tone: formal, auditable. Every conclusion must include a [citation] from context.
```
It isn’t just “a request.” It’s the **behavioral definition** of a task, like source code for your AI logic.

---

## 2. Why Prompts Need Version Control
In real projects, prompts evolve constantly. Someone does not think that format, adding new fields, or changing tone guidelines are significant. In fact, without version control, you’ll quickly hit chaos.

| Scenario | What Happens Without Versioning |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Report errors** | Output format changes leads to dashboard breaks |
| **Audit and compliance** | You can’t reproduce which prompt created which report |
| **Testing** | No way to roll out new prompts safely |
| **Collaboration** | Multiple people overwrite each other’s changes |
| **Rollback** | Once broken, you can’t restore the last stable version |

So we need to treat every prompt as a **deployable artifact** with a version number and approval record.

---

## 3. What “Prompt Versioning” Really Means
We’re not only tracking text, but also versioning **the model’s behavior**. It means what it’s allowed to do and how it formats results.

Each prompt version controls multiple aspects of the model’s behavior, from what it outputs to how it’s deployed. 
- The **output format** defines the structure, like a function’s return type in software.
- **Tone and rules** act as a style guide, ensuring the results sound consistent and auditable.
- The list of **allowed tools** restricts what external APIs the model can call, similar to setting API permissions.
- Every version keeps an **approval log**, like a commit history, so changes can be traced and reviewed.
- Finally, the **rollout** process, such as letting only 10% of users use the new version, works just like a canary release, ensuring safety before full deployment.

## 4. What Is a “Tool Contract”?
This is where many people get confused, because **Tool** doesn’t mean another AI like ChatGPT. 

A **Tool Contract** defines *what external APIs, functions, or services the model is allowed to call.*

Think of it as giving the AI “security guards” to interact with the outside world.

### Example
#### Prompt
```md
Generate a daily report and call write_back_sharepoint() to upload the results.
```
#### Tool Contract
```json
{
  "name": "write_back_sharepoint",
  "params": {
    "path": "string",
    "format": "string",
    "content": "string"
  },
  "returns": {
    "ok": "boolean",
    "url": "string"
  }
}
```
When the model runs, it doesn’t actually upload anything itself. It just produces a **call request** like this.
```json
{
  "tool": "write_back_sharepoint",
  "params": {
    "path": "reports/2025-10-21",
    "format": "json",
    "content": "{...}"
  }
}
```
Then your backend executes the API safely and logs the result. The **Tool Contracting** defines exactly *what* the model can do and *how* it does it.

## 5. Why Tool Contracting Matters

| Goal | Explanation | Benefit |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Control** | The model can only use approved APIs | Prevents misuse or security leaks |
| **Testing** | Contracts define fixed inputs and outputs | Easy to mock or unit-test |
| **Audit** | Every tool call is logged | Perfect traceability |
| **Team collaboration** | Separation between AI logic and APIs | Clear roles for dev and AI teams |

In short: 
> Prompt = *What to do*  
> Tool = *How (and what) the model is allowed to do it*

Together they form a reliable, testable, and secure AI task.

## 6. Approvals and Gradual Rollout
Prompts and tools are not changed directly in production. Every new version must be reviewed and recorded. 

### Approval Record
```md
# Approval — report.generate@v001
- Author: Alex
- Reviewer: Bob
- Date: 2025-09-24
- Decision: Approved for 10% rollout
```

### Gradual Rollout Example
Only 10% of requests use the new version.
```java
if (hash(traceId) % 100 < 10)
    use("report.generate@v001");
else
    use("report.generate@v000");
```
This lets you monitor new behavior safely before full deployment.

---

## 7. One-Click Rollback
Because prompts are versioned as static files, rollback is instant.
```bash
registry rollback report.generate v000
```
No rebuilds, no re-training, just revert and recover in seconds.

---

## 8. Conclusions
After implementing this structure, your AI system gains,
- **Prompt versioning**: Every change is traceable, reviewable, and reversible.
- **Tool contracts**: Safe API boundaries between model and system.
- **Gradual rollout**: 10% traffic test before full release.
- **One-click rollback**: Fast recovery from bad updates.
- **Audit trail**: Who changed what and when.

This turns your LLM workflow from a “black box” experiment into a **real, maintainable software system**.

> Prompt defines **what** the AI should do.   
> Tool contracts define **how** it can do it.   
> Versioning, approval, and rollback make both **safe, testable, and auditable**.

When you start treating prompts and tools like versioned software components, your AI stops being a fragile prototype and becomes a **production-grade, reliable system**.
