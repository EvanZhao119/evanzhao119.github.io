# The Reuse Layer: Governing AI as a Capability, Not a Credential

> Stop wiring every app to every vendor. Put all model or tool power behind one safe doorway, so teams **reuse** instead of **rebuild**.

## What is a “Capability Pool”?
It’s a **shared, governed toolbox** for your company’s AI work.  
Instead of each app holding its own keys and prompts, the pool **hides the keys**, **standardizes the contracts**, and **tracks cost and quality**.  
Apps call **one gateway**; the platform takes care of routing, quotas, bills, and safety. 
For example:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/run -H "Content-Type: application/json"   
-d '{"task":"report.generate",
     "input":{"period":"2025-08",
              "sourceIds":["sp:/dept/2025-08.xlsx"]},
              "policy":"finance",
              "tags":{"dept":"Ops"}
  }'
```

## Why should we care?
- **Ship faster:** integrate once, reuse everywhere.
- **Control cost and risk:** one place to see usage, cost, and who did what.
- **Change safely:** evaluation tests and human sampling mean upgrades aren’t gambles.

## What’s inside the pool?
- **Models and compute:** LLMs, embeddings, batch inference queues.
- **Tools and functions:** search, DB access, external APIs, internal actions.
- **Knowledge:** RAG indexes, curated corpora, permission-aware views.
- **Policies:** routing rules, quotas, redaction, data residency, risk controls.

## What makes it different?

| Not this… | But this… |
|---|---|
| Shared key vault | **Stable contracts** (Prompt/Tool) that hide raw keys |
| Service catalog only | **Orchestration**: route, limit, audit, **settle cost** |
| Offline model registry | **Runtime governance** with tests, sampling, rollback |

## Minimal architecture 
- **Gateway:** single entry; routing, quotas, policies, redaction.
- **Capability Registry:** Prompt/Tool contracts, versions, approvals, canary.
- **RAG Layer:** index and retrieval wired to permissions.
- **Evaluation:** regression/AB checks before rollouts.
- **Human Review:** smart sampling and escalation when needed.
- **Observability and Ledger:** traces, logs, metrics, **usage and cost**.

## How do apps talk to the pool?
**Inputs:** `task` (what to do), `input` (data), `policy` (rules), `tags` (for cost/ownership)  
**Outputs:** result and a **trace** with usage, cost, route, eval status, and review status.

**Example trace (conceptual):**
```json
{
  "traceId": "9e1a...",
  "contract": "prompt:report.generate@v2",
  "route": "gptx:2025-08-canary",
  "quotaUsed": {"tokens": 18342},
  "cost": {"currency": "USD", "amount": 1.92, "tags": {"dept":"Ops"}},
  "evals": {"suite":"regression-v5","status":"pass"},
  "humanReview": {"sampled": true, "status": "approved"}
}
```

## What are our KPIs?
- **Reuse rate:** % of capabilities used by **2+ apps**
- **Blast radius:** apps affected per prompt/model change (lower is better)
- **Time‑to‑availability:** request to usable in prod (median)
- **Cost visibility:** % spend with app/team/use‑case attribution
- **Compliance coverage:** audit completeness; human sampling hit rate
