# Spring WebFlux Optimization Guide
Spring WebFlux is a **reactive, non-blocking web framework** introduced in Spring 5.  
It is designed for high-concurrency systems, but if you don’t use it properly, performance can actually get worse.  
This guide will walk you through **practical optimizations for WebFlux** so you can unlock its full potential.

---

## 1. Why Optimize WebFlux?
- WebFlux uses **reactive streams + non-blocking I/O**.  
- It’s great for high traffic and concurrent apps.  
- But introducing **blocking APIs** or misusing schedulers can easily hurt performance. 

**Key takeaway:** Optimization ensures WebFlux stays **truly non-blocking**.

---

## 2. Avoid Blocking Calls
**Common mistakes:**
- Using `JdbcTemplate`, `RestTemplate`, or traditional file I/O inside WebFlux. 
- These block the event loop threads and lead to reduced throughput.  

**Better approach:**
- Use **R2DBC** instead of JDBC.  
- Use **WebClient** instead of RestTemplate.  
- For unavoidable blocking tasks, use `Schedulers.boundedElastic()`.

```java
Mono.fromCallable(() -> jdbcTemplate.queryForObject("SELECT ...", String.class))
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic());
```

---

## 3. Use Schedulers Wisely
- Reactor has only a **small number of event loop threads** (usually one per CPU core). 
- For **CPU-heavy work**, use `parallel()`.  
- For **blocking I/O tasks**, use `boundedElastic()`.  
- Avoid too many `publishOn` / `subscribeOn` calls, because thread switching is expensive.

---

## 4. Handle Backpressure
- Backpressure: **consumer controls data flow from producer**.  
- Flux supports backpressure out of the box. 
- If the source (like a message queue) doesn’t, you must handle it manually.   
- **Strategies:**
    - `onBackpressureBuffer()`: buffer extra data.  
    - `onBackpressureDrop()`: drop when overloaded.
    - `limitRate()`: limit how fast to consume.

---

## 5. Optimize JSON & Serialization
- WebFlux uses **Jackson** by default, which can become a bottleneck.  
- Options to optimize:
    - Use **Kotlinx Serialization** or **Json-B**.
    - Enable **Jackson streaming** for large data.  
    - Stream with `DataBuffer` instead of loading entire objects.

---

## 6. Connection Pool & Resource Tuning 
- `WebClient` uses **Reactor Netty** with connection pooling.  
- Tips:
    - Tune pool size with `maxConnections`.  
    - Set proper `responseTimeout`.  
    - Reuse `WebClient` instances instead of creating new ones.

---

## 7. Monitoring & Debugging

- Use **BlockHound** to detect accidental blocking calls.  
- Add **Micrometer + Prometheus + Grafana** for latency & throughput monitoring.  
- Debug streams with Reactor’s built-in logger:

```java
flux.log("my-debug")
```

---

## 8. Practical Optimization Steps
1. Eliminate blocking APIs.  
2. Use schedulers correctly (parallel vs boundedElastic).  
3. Apply backpressure strategies.  
4. Tune JSON serialization & connection pools.  
5. Add monitoring & debugging tools.  

---

## Final Takeaway
**WebFlux optimization: keeping it truly non-blocking.**  

With careful tuning of APIs, schedulers, backpressure, and monitoring, your apps can scale smoothly to handle massive traffic.
